# Chat with your data [Fabric] Workshop

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to build and deploy agentic AI applications using Microsoft’s Unified Data Foundation (UDF) solution accelerator. This lab walks you through integrating Microsoft Fabric, Azure AI, containerized microservices, and orchestration workflows to create intelligent, production-ready agentic solutions.

By the end of this workshop, you will understand how structured data, enterprise analytics, and LLM-based agents work together to power next-generation enterprise applications.

## Objectives

- **Lab 01: Deployment & Environment Setup:** In this hands-on lab, participants will Deploy the Unified Data Foundation solution accelerator resources, understand architecture components, and explore Microsoft Fabric, AI services, and container apps deployed through automation.

- **Lab 02: Working with the Data Foundation (Fabric + OneLake):** In this hands-on lab, participants will learn how data flows into the Lakehouse, explore SQL endpoints, create Dataflows Gen2, and work with the Fabric workspace deployed as part of the solution accelerator.


- **Lab 03: Building and Extending Agentic Applications:** In this hands-on lab, participants will configure agent workflows using Azure AI Foundry or Azure OpenAI, connect them to operational data, and test container-based APIs deployed as part of the accelerator.

- **Lab 04: Orchestration, APIs & End-to-End Scenario:** In this hands-on lab, participants will examine how the agent interacts with backend microservices, trigger business processes, and view the entire agentic workflow end-to-end.
## Prerequisites

Participants should have:

- A basic understanding of Microsoft Azure and resource groups
- Familiarity with Microsoft Fabric, including Lakehouse and Dataflows
- Basic understanding of Azure OpenAI, vector search, and LLM-based applications
- Some experience with REST APIs, containers, or microservices
